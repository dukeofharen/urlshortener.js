# Node.js + Express.js URL shortener
A simple URL shortener created with Node.js + Express.js + MySQL.

## Installation

1. Download the files to the location you would like application to be.
1. Go to the folder with the command line and execute `npm install`, so all dependencies will be installed.
1. In your MySQL database, create a new table and execute `urlshortener.sql`
1. In `constants.js`, fill in the correct MySQL settings and fill in your root URL (e.g. http://d.co/ or http://localhost:3500/)
1. If you install this script on your server and you have a custom short domain, make sure you create a reverse proxy in your Apache or Nginx (or any other server), so your domain (e.g. d.co) points to `http://localhost:3500/` (or any other port number you've configured).

## Note

This script is meant to be used as a public URL shortener. If you want to use this script for personal use, you have to include some sort of authentication.
